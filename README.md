# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to detect whether a news article is **FAKE** or **REAL** using text classification techniques.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression
- 
# Data Not Included
The `Fake.csv` and `True.csv` datasets are too large to upload to GitHub.

You can download them manually from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) and place them inside the `data/` folder:

- `data/Fake.csv`
- `data/True.csv`
